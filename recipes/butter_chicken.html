                <p>In a large skillet or pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent.</p>
                <p>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</p>
                <p>Now, add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides.</p>
                <p>In a small bowl, mix together the ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, turmeric, and garam masala. Sprinkle this spice mixture over the chicken, stirring well to coat evenly.</p>

                <p>Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt according to your taste. Allow the sauce to simmer for an additional 5 minutes to thicken slightly.</p>
                <p>Remove the pan from the heat. Garnish the butter chicken with fresh cilantro leaves.</p>
